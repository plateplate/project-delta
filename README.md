# ClickLess — Improve tiny, annoying inputs so users click less
Purpose: Demonstrate a common UI inefficiency (long dropdowns) and show a faster alternative with fewer clicks.
User Story: As a user, I want to enter expiry/timer/date values faster so I click fewer times and finish tasks more quickly.
Tagline: Pick a date faster — fewer clicks, less wait.
## Test case
1. Open page and DevTools console.
2. Try selecting month/year in BEFORE panel (dropdowns).
3. Try same in AFTER panel (grid + +/- year).
Metric: compare clicks/time logged to console.
